# JXcomp
#This is a program made by CrisDev2004.

Hello. It is my first project uploaded on GitHub. JXcomp is a Java compiler. Have fun using it! Wrote in Shell Script programming language. I have Linux Ubuntu, so I am sure it works on Linux. But if you have Windows or MacOS, im not sure it will work. I will make it universal compatible in some time. If you want to run it on Windows, install Git and normally it will work fine. To execute it, just write "cd <location>" in the Command Promt (cmd.exe) and run "sh jxcomp.sh". If you are on MacOS, write "chmod +x jxcomp.sh" and next, run it with this command: "sh path/to/file/jxcomp.sh". This is the V1.0 of this software. To execute it, execute the command "chmod +x jxcomp.sh" and then "./jxcomp.sh" (without the quotes). (method for Linux).
